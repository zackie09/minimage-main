                                            Tailwind Elements simplifies the process of adding a dark mode to your
                                            project. By
                                            utilizing Tailwind's classes and a dark variant, you can effortlessly
                                            integrate a
                                            dual-themed website. Our components come equipped with the dark theme
                                            variant as a
                                            default feature. Furthermore, like any Tailwind project, the default theme
                                            can be
                                            personalized by modifying the project's color palette, type scale, fonts,
                                            breakpoints, border radius values, and other attributes through the
                                            tailwind.config.js configuration file.

                                            Tailwind CSS offers a seamless way to build modern websites without having
                                            to leave
                                            your HTML. The framework functions by scanning all of your HTML files,
                                            JavaScript
                                            components, and templates for class names, automatically generating
                                            corresponding
                                            styles, and writing them to a static CSS file. This approach is fast,
                                            flexible, and
                                            reliable, requiring zero runtime. Whether you need to create form layouts,
                                            tables,
                                            or modal dialogs, Tailwind CSS provides everything necessary to design
                                            beautiful,

                                            shopping carts, and product views, making it the ideal choice for developing
                                            your
                                            next e-commerce front-end.
